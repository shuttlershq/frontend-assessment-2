# frontend-assessment
As part of our application process, we'd like to see what you can produce by giving you a take home assessment.

# Test Specification
Implement the dashboard design as seen on this Figma board (https://www.figma.com/file/I111OIoiDfecjpTuHRbM6M/Shuttlers-Frontend-Assesment?node-id=0%3A1).

# Expectations
You are expected to use their Intuition and creativity to fill in the missing blanks. We will be testing for Skill, Intuition and Creativity

Please take note of the following points:

- Only use Vue or React to get it done
- You have just 2 days to complete the test.
- Any Css framework is fine. Tailwindcss will be an added advantage
- A Mobile Responsive design will be an added advantage
- Also make sure that your project is on github and accessible to us

You'll be assessed based on but not limited to the following:

- Design implementation
- Coding pattern
- Proper Component decomposition and reuse
- Correctness of javascript syntax
- Demonstration of knowledge of the chosen framework between Vue or React

To complete your homework, please fork this repo and commit your work to your fork and when you're done, send relevant details to engineering@shuttlers.ng
You can reach out to david.jaiyeola@shuttlers.ng if you have any questions.
